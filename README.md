# Jim Leonardo
I am a software development leader with over 20 years of experience helping teams and organizations succeed. Leading transformative Software Development is my bread and butter; my passion is helping businesses succeed at their strategic goals while creating an inclusive environment where people can do their best work, feel fulfilled, and meet both their personal and professional goals.

If you need mentoring, help with your software strategy, or just getting work done, I offer my services as a freelance software advisor, leader, architect, and developer through [Jim Leonardo Development Services](https://www.jimleodev.com).
 

My current side projects:
1. <https://www.jimsrules.com> - I’m working on the website Jim’s Rules to share my experience and (shaky) opinions about teamwork and leadership in software development. In my opinion, there aren’t enough people talking about these topics at a broad level. When the topics do come up, they are focused on how to manage processes and tasks (e.g., [Agile Software Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development), [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)), [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)), [Continuous Integration & Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD)). Enough digital ink gets spilled on those topics, I would just be going over the same ground if I discussed them directly. Instead, I will focus on the broader topics related to team, people, and getting stuff done. That *will* mean we touch on things like Agile and CI/CD, they just won't be the main focus.

    I write few deep-dive technology articles for the same reason. There are so many people who generate technology content daily that I would just be echoing what's already been said. What I can do is share a little of what I've learned with those technologies and everyone around them to help navigate the world of software development to not just create software, but also create successful products and have a fulfilling career.

1. <https://github.com/jimleonardo/Expressur> - a library to handle calculating basic formula that users may enter an application, including using variables. Nothing earth shatttering here. Mostly I created this just to have something that can easily be ported into other programming languages for evaluating the languages themselves.
1. <https://github.com/jimleonardo/hello_evolved> - "Hello World" isn't much of a sample program, it's just an intro. I wanted something that would let more experienced developers understand the very basics of a language (if statements, loops) in a glance, so here's my own attempt.
1. <https://github.com/jimleonardo/essential_math_for_data_science> - Data science is math heavy and computers are for math and I've been working with computers for a while. Still, it was time to dust off those college math skills (and then some), so I picked up Essential Math for Data Science.
    
    This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks that I used as my scratch pad as I worked through the book. The exercises here are my own but heavily influenced by the examples in the book. I didn't reproduce the examples from the book unless there was no other way to express similar concepts (e.g., the interest rate calculation exercise). I really recommend getting the book if you need to brush up on some of the college-level math you may have forgotten.
