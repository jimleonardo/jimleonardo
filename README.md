# Jim Leonardo
I am a hands-on software development leader with 20+ years of experience. Cloud, Agile and DevOps transformations are my bread and butter, helping businesses succeed at their strategic goals is my passion. Since 2012, I have been focused on leading the development of public facing, cloud based applications using Microsoft Azure technologies.

My current side project efforts are focused on the Blazor Framework. You can find some projects at <https://github.com/SpiralAngle>

1. <https://github.com/SpiralAngle/SpiralAngle.Blazor.Samples.Forms> - a sample project whose purpose is to show off both Blazor EditForms in a real working example as well as provide a use case to develop the SpiralAngle.Blazor.Extensions library.
2. <https://github.com/SpiralAngle/SpiralAngle.Blazor.Extensions> - a collection of code helpers designed to simplify common Blazor tasks.
3. <https://github.com/jimleonardo/Expressur> - a library to handle calculating basic formula that users may enter an application, including using variables. Nothing earth shatttering here. Mostly I created this just to have something that can easily be ported into other programming languages for evaluating the languages themselves.
