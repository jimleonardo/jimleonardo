I am a hands-on software development leader with 20+ years of experience. I am a software development leader with over 20 years of experience helping teams succeed. Leading transformative Software Development is my bread and butter; my passion is helping businesses succeed at their strategic goals while creating an inclusive environment where people can do their best work, feel fulfilled, and meet both their personal and professional goals.
 

My current side project efforts are focused on the Blazor Framework. You can find some projects at <https://github.com/SpiralAngle>

1. <https://github.com/SpiralAngle/SpiralAngle.Blazor.Samples.Forms> - a sample project whose purpose is to show off both Blazor EditForms in a real working example as well as provide a use case to develop the SpiralAngle.Blazor.Extensions library.
2. <https://github.com/SpiralAngle/SpiralAngle.Blazor.Extensions> - a collection of code helpers designed to simplify common Blazor tasks.
3. <https://github.com/jimleonardo/Expressur> - a library to handle calculating basic formula that users may enter an application, including using variables. Nothing earth shatttering here. Mostly I created this just to have something that can easily be ported into other programming languages for evaluating the languages themselves.
